# What is this place? 

This README is kind of like one of those Indiana Jones jungle temples, but filled with tales of learning quests and links to mysterious repos instead of gems and ancient trinkets. It's where we show all the finished projects from the W3Develops ecosystem. 

It's an ever-growing ode to people coming together to learn and build. Each project, no matter how ambitious or playful, represents strangers from across the world who came together to build something.  

# What is the mission? 

1) To get 200 projects in here by the winter (2019). 

2) To have 1000 projects in here by the winter (2021).

If you haven't heard of Freecodecamp, I don't believe you (no just joking, you can find them [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com)). <br>

## 1 -> [w3Develops cohorts begin](https://w3develops.org)

**Project Description**: We group motivated individuals with shared goals together to learn and build. 

**Project Story**: I'd just made what was an extremely difficult decision (at the time) to pull out of a coding bootcamp. I was going to code full time using FCC and other online resources. I enjoyed the group vibe in the bootcamp precourse so I put a call out in the FreeCodeCamp forum. I was hoping at least 10 or so people would respond to it. About 50 people did, and off we went.
